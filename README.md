# GDTF parser

**Work in progress!**

GDTF stands for General Device Type Format which is a standard for describing devices used for lighting industry like moving heads or fog machines.

This repository will become a rust library to parse these .gdtf files in a structs and can be used to implement lighting consoles or visualizers. 

Currently it's not planned to expand the library to create new .gdtf files, since there is a online tool available for that.

The library uses quick-xml as dependency
